          <h2>Setup</h2>
          <p>
            Place the game board in the center of the play-space, with the pile
            of Blood Tokens reachable for all players. Shuffle the location
            tiles with their symbols up, and place each at a location with the
            matching symbol, face down.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each player chooses a faction to play as containing Units, a Faction
            Sheet, an Action Deck, and a Victory Deck. Check the Factions Page
            for unique setups for certain factions.

          <h2>How to Play</h2>
